4 OOP Principles :
Inheritance: the Animal class is a parent class for the animal species listed in the code.

Encapsulation: encapsulates the species and age attribute by making the attribute private then using public & setter methods to modify those attributes.

Abstraction: The Animal class is a simplified representation of an animal without revealing the details of the implementations.

Usage :
- Animal() = create a new animal species and sets their age
- setAge() = update the age of the animal

  How to run :
  - copy the repository
  - compile the java codes
  - run the RunAnimal class
 
Output :
Species: Lion
Age: 6
Updated Age: 6
Species: Cat
Age: 4
Updated Age: 4
Species: Dog
Age: 5
Updated Age: 5
